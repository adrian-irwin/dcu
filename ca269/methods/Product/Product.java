    Create a class called Product with one static method called multiply. This method should take two integer parameters and return the product of those parameters. Your method could be used by the following main method. (Note that you don't supply this method, it will be supplied by the system.)

    Note that you don't create any main method. Just the multiply method which will be called by another method.
    
    If you get an error, it could be because
    1. You didn't create a Product class.
    2. The Product class didn't have a multiply method.
    3. The multiply method wasn't public static.
    4. The multiply method didn't have two int parameters and didn't return an int variable.
