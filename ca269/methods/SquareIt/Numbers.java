/*
    Create a class called Numbers with one static method called square. This method should take an integer parameter and return the square of that parameter. Your method will be used by the following main method. (Note that you don't supply this main method, it will be supplied by the system.)
    
    Note that you don't create any main method. Just the square method which will be called by another method.

    If you get an error, it could be because
    1. You didn't create a Numbers class.
    2. It didn't have a square method.
    3. The square method wasn't public static.
    4. The square method didn't have an int parameter and didn't return an int variable.
